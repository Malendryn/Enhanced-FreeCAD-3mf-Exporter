# Enhanced-FreeCAD-3mf-Exporter
A 3MF exporter that allows you to set properties that are available to other software that imports this file.  Its primary use is to allow you to set values on an object in FreeCad (such as infill density) that will be used by 3D Slicers such as Ultimaker Cura upon loading.

See the file 'Readme_HowToUse.md' for further instructions.
See the file 'README_HowToFindTheVariables.md' to find the names of the properties that Cura will recognize. 
Link to Youtube video explaining its use in more detail. -->  https://youtu.be/YgbacugzE6c
